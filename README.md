A different way of writing web apps.


## TODOS

* framework
    * modal and other framed views
    * replayable interactions! (see `saveReplay`, `loadReplay`)
    * interruptable animations
    * realtime updates without triggering rerender
    * debounce yeets so that you don't double-trigger logic.
* example app
    * use real db instead of memory
    * break flows out into separate files
    * update the heck out of the UI

* DONE
    * realtime streams / events
    * sexy transitions
    * routing

## philosophy

There's a great many things that standard web frameworks do and do well.
There's equally or more things they do not do well.
We do not want to find another way to do the same thing.
We want to pave the road for something better.
Let's improve interactivity, reduce learning barriers, and represent thoughts
more fluently; all while making the programming more straightforward.

* Don't spend your time thinking of how to recreate user interfaces that
  already exist, but instead do something that will set you apart from the
  rest.
* Constraints foster creativity. Design an immersive experience that plays to
  the freedoms and constraints of your system.
  For instance, turn your "constraints" into "features". Like designing a game
  where the mechanics work really well with your team and tech. 
* Choose problems that play to your strengths. Don't waste time solving the
  stuff that's already been done a million times. Become the pioneer and
  luminary on these problems.
