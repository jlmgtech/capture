# director
A totally different way of using react!


## TODOS

* framework
    * sexy transitions
    * modal and other framed views
    * figure out how realtime streams could participate (maybe with the react parts?)
* example app
    * use real db instead of memory
    * break flows out into separate files
    * update the heck out of the UI

* DONE
    * fix director being called multiple times in StrictMode (React runs things 2x to check for impurities in functional components)
    * replayable interactions! (see `saveReplay`, `loadReplay`)
